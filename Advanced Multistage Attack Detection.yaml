DisplayName           : Test Advanced Multistage Attack Detection
Description           : Using Fusion technology based on machine learning, Azure Sentinel automatically detects 
                        multistage attacks by identifying combinations of anomalous behaviors and suspicious 
                        activities observed at various stages of the kill chain. On the basis of these discoveries, 
                        Azure Sentinel generates incidents that would otherwise be very difficult to catch. By design, 
                        these incidents are low-volume, high-fidelity, and high-severity, which is why this detection 
                        is turned ON by default.
                        
                        There are a total of 70 Fusion incident types detected by Azure Sentinel.
                        - 65 of these show the combination of suspicious Azure Active Directory sign-in events 
                        followed by anomalous Office 365 activity. Out of these 65, 30 are in public preview. 
                        - The remaining five incident types show the combination of anomalous signals from Microsoft 
                        Defender Advanced Threat Protection and from Palo Alto Networks firewalls. These five types 
                        are all in public preview.
                        
                        To detect these multistage attacks, the following data connectors must be configured:
                        - Azure Active Directory Identity Protection.
                        - Microsoft Cloud App Security.
                        - Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection.
                        - Palo Alto Networks.
                        
                        For a full list and description of each scenario that is supported for these multistage 
                        attacks, go to https://aka.ms/SentinelFusion.
